#extract the data from Spr√•kbanken's corpora. This is a long process which will download several gigabytes of data. It is possible that it will crash due to some unforeseen exception on the server side. In this case, you will have to restart it manually and tweak the script so that it does not download those data which it has already collected. In short: do not run this step unless you absolutely must.
